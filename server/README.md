This repo will hold the server-side code for the screenshot application


RUN and UPLOAD
$ cargo run
view http://127.0.0.1:8000/public
drag and drop photo into page
(now file is encoded in current directory)

RETRIEVE a photo
TODO how do I GET that photo??

UPDATE March 18th, 2023, actually dropzone wasn't in the upload Viktor gave me...if we still want to do it that way upload that "html" folder

Thirdparty Tools
- https://unpkg.com/dropzone@5/dist/min/dropzone.min.js
- https://unpkg.com/dropzone@5/dist/min/dropzone.min.css
Might want to periodically upgrade our local copies
